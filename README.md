# autotrashcleaner
An auto trash cleaner for wordpress 

If you have a website that deletes more than 1000 post per day this plugin will help slowly and automatically clean out your trash bin without overloading your server (espically on a shared server)
just enable it and it will run until the trash bin is empty.

Once active you can find (Auto trash Cleaner) in the settings tab. 

There are known issues like once it finishes the delete counter counts into the negatives until you restart it for its next job.  Will fix that soon.
